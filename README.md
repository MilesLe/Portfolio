# Portfolio

Here I have a collection of my work.
1. I have included a subset of my art portfolio which highlights a personal and creative side of me. I use my art to express myself and communicate ideas/stories nonconventionally and poetically. 
2. I also have included some programming projects:
  - The Arduino Leap Motion project showcases my ability to work with API's and complex sensors with robotics. 
  - The Neural Network project demonstrates my eagerness and curiosity to learn about machine learning models. Despite not having the required math knowledge to implement complex models, I used my understanding of biology to implement a machine learning model inspired by genetics. I programmed my model without aid from a machine learning API or library. This project's purpose was to educate and motivate myself, not to build an effective model. 
  - The Tensorflow Rock Paper Scissors project shows my ability to use a common machine learning API and adapt prewritten code to a new project idea. 
3. Lastly, I have included research posters I have produced with a team of other students in the field of bioengineering. My posters demonstrate my experience with conducting research, designing and preforming experimentation, and clearly communicating results.
