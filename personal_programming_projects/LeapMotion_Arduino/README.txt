These programs use a Leap Motion API and JohnnyFive library in order to allow a leap motion 3D optical sensor to communicate with an Arduino to control the position of a quadcopter and orientation of a two servo "arm".

Purpose: To allow the user to control a robotic arm or quadcopter with the spacial position and angular orientation of their hand.
