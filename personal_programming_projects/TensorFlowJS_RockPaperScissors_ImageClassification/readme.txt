README

The purpose of this project is to take an open source example of machine learning image classification from Google's Tensorflow and modify the code for a game of Rock Paper Scissors. Doing so will allow me to get introductory experience on using Tensorflow to create machine learning models. 

This code allows the user to create a image classification model that recognizes when the user is playing a rock, paper, or scissors by their hand gestures via the computer camera. The training data set is provided by the user at the program start up. Once, training of the model is complete, the user can play a game of versus the computer using their hand as if they were playing against another person. 

To play this game, open the index.html file.
