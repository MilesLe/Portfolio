The purpose of this project is to take an open source example of machine learning image classification from Google's Tensorflow and modify the code for a game of Rock Paper Scissors. Doing so has allowed me to get introductory experience with using Tensorflow to create machine learning models. 

This code allows the user to create an image classification model that recognizes when the user is playing a rock, paper, or scissors by their hand gestures via the computer camera. The training data set is provided by the user at the program start up. Once, training of the model is complete, the user can play a game of versus the computer using their hand as if they were playing against another person. 

To play this game, open/run the index.html file. Then, you must provide training data for the model by pressing the "rock", "paper", "scissors", and "nothing" button while showing the described hand position to the camera. Once the model has captured at least 50 photos of your hand in each position, you can press the "Rand" button to play the game with the computer. In order to provide the best training data, make sure to make slight adjustments to your hand position while caputing photos so the model is trained on a more diverse set of data. Also, in order to get the most accurate results from the model, make sure you have a background with a single solid color that isn't similar to the color of your hand.
