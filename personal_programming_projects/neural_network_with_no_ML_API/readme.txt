The purpose of this project is for me to self teach myself and get hands on experience with the basic concepts of machine learning. I developed the entire machine learning model and program from scratch. At the time, I was not able to implement common and effective machine learning principles because they required multivariable calculus and linear algebra. So, I implemented a machine learning strategy that is inspired by biology, specifically evolution.

Although this project wasn't entirely successful at producing an effective machine learning model, this project allowed me to get a better understanding of what machine learning is and furthered my interest in the subject.
